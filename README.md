 🖥️ Terminal Portfolio

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my terminal-style portfolio — a fun, nerdy little experiment where you can explore my work like you're inside a command-line interface.

If you enjoy the simplicity and power of a terminal, you're in for a treat. Type a few commands, poke around, and get to know me the geeky way.


 🚀 What’s Inside

-> Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
-> A fully interactive terminal UI using React
-> Type in commands like `about`, `projects`, or `contact` to navigate
-> Some animated ASCII magic ✨ to keep things interesting


 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is made using tools I love working with:

-> ⚡ Next.js (to keep things fast and smooth)  
-> 🎬 Framer Motion (to add subtle animations)  
-> ⌨️ Custom CLI logic to simulate that terminal feel

 üñ•Ô∏è Terminal Portfolio

Hey there! üëã  
Welcome to my terminal-style portfolio ‚Äî a fun, nerdy little experiment where you can explore my work like you're inside a command-line interface.

If you enjoy the simplicity and power of a terminal, you're in for a treat. Type a few commands, poke around, and get to know me the geeky way.


 üöÄ What‚Äôs Inside

-> Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
-> A fully interactive terminal UI using React
-> Type in commands like `about`, `projects`, or `contact` to navigate
-> Some animated ASCII magic ‚ú® to keep things interesting


 üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is made using tools I love working with:

-> ‚ö° Next.js (to keep things fast and smooth)  
-> üé¨ Framer Motion (to add subtle animations)  
-> ‚å®Ô∏è Custom CLI logic to simulate that terminal feel
